## Introduction
Video games have become a very large industry in our ever-growing world. Hundreds of games are being developed over the year, but
few are being noticed and many other ones are having poor rating due to user evaluation of the game. In fact,
not many game developers tend to make observations that would actually help them improve player experience. Things like surveys
are hard to make and hardly ever made right, therefore developers don't get honest feedback from players, which they really look
forward to. Although despite surveys there are many other user research methods to get feedback from players. It can be either 
qualitative or quantitative. But in this paper only a few quantitative methods will be disscussed, such as physiological data, 
eye tracking and task analysis.

Quantitative methods of user research are aimed to collect only numerical data. Moreover, analysed using mathematical and/or 
statistical methods (cite - https://www.skillsyouneed.com/learn/quantitative-and-qualitative.html).
These usually are polls, questionnaires and surveys, but many more can be manipulated by computational techniques. (cite - https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/quantitative). 
Quantitative methods do not take place in natural settings. In fact, participants cannot explain their choices. (cite https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a87b/ce9f2d5fe771005a2890c92da2cff8a03b32.pdf).
As the name suggests, it's better to use large amount of participants to get better and more accurate data (cite Denscombe, M. (2010). The Good Research Guide: for small-scale social research. McGraw Hill.).


## Physiological Data
Physiological data usually requires lots of different measurement systems, such as skin conductance response (SCR), 
electromyography (EMG), heart rate (HR) computed from electrocardiogram (EKG), electroencephalography (EEG), body temperature 
and pupil dilations (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences). 
But rarely enough they all are being used due to the cost of setting all up. A small combination of these would be enough, 
for example SCR, HR and pupil dilations. But even that would require some sensors to be stuck either on face or hands, 
which could disturb some participants and totally change the game experience, that's the most important (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences).
Although this would give more accurate understanding of the player experience there is another way of getting instant feedback using think-aloud method. This method requires participants to say whatever they feel while playing the game. This method, in fact, would not be as precise as the other one because the participant has to think about how to give better feedback, which can ruin his/her experience as a player. But this could be used in short-term experiments, in essence 5-minute of gameplay instead of 30-minute.
