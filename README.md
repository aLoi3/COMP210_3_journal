## Introduction
Video games have become a very large industry in our ever-growing world. Hundreds of games are being developed over the year, but
few are being noticed and many other ones are having poor rating due to user evaluation of the game. In fact,
not many game developers tend to make observations that would actually help them improve player experience. Things like surveys
are hard to make and hardly ever made right, therefore developers don't get honest feedback from players, which they really look
forward to. Although despite surveys there are many other user research methods to get feedback from players. It can be either 
qualitative or quantitative. But in this paper only a few quantitative methods will be discussed, such as physiological data, 
eye tracking and task analysis.

Quantitative methods of user research are aimed to collect only numerical data. Moreover, analysed using mathematical and/or 
statistical methods (cite - https://www.skillsyouneed.com/learn/quantitative-and-qualitative.html).
These usually are polls, questionnaires and surveys, but many more can be manipulated by computational techniques. (cite - https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/quantitative). 
Quantitative methods do not take place in natural settings. In fact, participants cannot explain their choices. (cite https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a87b/ce9f2d5fe771005a2890c92da2cff8a03b32.pdf).
As the name suggests, it's better to use large amount of participants to get better and more accurate data (cite Denscombe, M. (2010). The Good Research Guide: for small-scale social research. McGraw Hill.).


## Physiological Data
Physiological data has become an influencial evaluation method in games industry (cite Physiological Measures for Game Evaluation). This method measures one's emotions during his/her gameplay, which, in fact, gives sometimes useful information about the game experience. But it is better to use with another method to have a comparison in case systems give somewhat wrong details as mentioned in (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences).
It usually requires lots of different measurement systems, such as galvanic skin responce (GSR), 
electromyography (EMG), heart rate (HR) computed from electrocardiogram (EKG), electroencephalography (EEG), body temperature 
and pupil dilations (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences and https://faculty.uoit.ca/nacke/publications/Nacke-Ch26-GameAnalytics.pdf). 
But rarely enough they all are being used due to the cost of setting all up. A small combination of these would be enough, 
for example SCR, HR and pupil dilations. But even that would require some sensors to be stuck either on face or hands, 
which could disturb some participants and totally change the game experience, that's the most important (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences).
Although this would give more accurate understanding of the player experience there is another way of getting instant feedback using think-aloud method. This method requires participants to say whatever they feel while playing the game. This method, in fact, would not be as precise as the other one because the participant has to think about how they actually feel to give better feedback, which can ruin his/her experience as a player. But this could be used in short-term experiments, in essence 5-minute of gameplay instead of 30-minute. Nonetheless, as the experiment shows in (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences), which included both think-aloud and physiological data methods, some of the important moments were indicated with EMG, but participants did not say anything about that, which could be left unnoticed.
Player emotions while playing a game are very important and developers usually think thoroughly throughout the development process.
They want some moments to be thrilling or sad or funny to make them memorable for any player. Game designers and user researchers are often looking for methods to better undertand player emotions (cite https://faculty.uoit.ca/nacke/publications/Nacke-Ch26-GameAnalytics.pdf) to make their game more immersive. Researchers do such evaluation because emotionals are hard to fake (cite http://hcigames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Games-User-Research-and-Physiological-Game-Evaluation.pdf), especially when it involves gaming as concetration focused on particular task and so every player reaction is going to be spontaneous. 

## Task Analysis
Task analysis is used for breaking a task into small subtasks (cite https://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/sites/autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/files/TaskAnalyis_Steps_0.pdf) and analysing how one is accomplishing it. JoAnn Hackos and Jenice Redish in their book *User and Task Analysis fo Interface Design* (CITE) note a few points to better understand this method:
* What users' goals are;
* What users do to achieve their goal;
* What previous experience users had before accomplishing a task;
* How users are influenced by physical environment;
* How users previous experience influence tasks' understanding and its workflow.

Also, it's important to note, that the best time to perform task analysis is early in the development proccess, especially for design work (cite https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/task-analysis.html). Though in most cases task analysis can be beneficial in terms of, for example, discovering what tasks one's website/app should support or making sure the site is efficient, effective and satisfying to users designers should also be aware of over-analysing (cite http://www.usabilitybok.org/task-analysis). Complex problems might be time-consuming, in addition to getting caught in analysis paralysis, where "more and more detail is investigated" (cite http://www.usabilitybok.org/task-analysis).
