## Introduction
Video games have become a very large industry in our ever-growing world. Hundreds of games are being developed over the year, but few are being noticed and many other ones are having poor rating due to user evaluation of the game. In fact, not many game developers tend to make observations that would actually help them improve player experience. Things like surveys are hard to make and hardly ever made right, therefore developers don't get honest feedback from players, which they really look forward to. Although despite surveys there are many other user research methods to get feedback from players. It can be either qualitative or quantitative. But in this paper, only a few quantitative methods will be discussed, such as physiological data, eye tracking, and task analysis.

Quantitative methods of user research are aimed to collect only numerical data. Moreover, analyzed using mathematical and/or statistical methods (cite - https://www.skillsyouneed.com/learn/quantitative-and-qualitative.html). These usually are polls, questionnaires, and surveys, but many more can be manipulated by computational techniques. (cite - https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/quantitative). Quantitative methods do not take place in natural settings. In fact, participants cannot explain their choices. (cite https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a87b/ce9f2d5fe771005a2890c92da2cff8a03b32.pdf). As the name suggests, it's better to use a large number of participants to get better and more accurate data (cite Denscombe, M. (2010). The Good Research Guide: for small-scale social research. McGraw Hill.). (200)


## Physiological Data
Physiological data has become an influential evaluation method in the games industry (cite Physiological Measures for Game Evaluation). This method measures one's emotions during his/her gameplay, which, in fact, gives sometimes useful information about the game experience. But it is better to use with another method to have a comparison in case systems give somewhat wrong details as mentioned in (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences).
It usually requires lots of different measurement systems, such as galvanic skin response (GSR), 
electromyography (EMG), heart rate (HR) computed from electrocardiogram (EKG), electroencephalography (EEG), body temperature 
and pupil dilations (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences and https://faculty.uoit.ca/nacke/publications/Nacke-Ch26-GameAnalytics.pdf). 
But rarely enough they all are being used due to the cost of setting all up. A small combination of these would be enough, 
for example, SCR, HR and pupil dilations. But even that would require some sensors to be stuck either on face or hands, 
which could disturb some participants and totally change the game experience, that's the most important (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences).
Although this would give a more accurate understanding of the player experience there is another way of getting instant feedback using the think-aloud method. This method requires participants to say whatever they feel while playing the game. This method, in fact, would not be as precise as the other one because the participant has to think about how they actually feel to give better feedback, which can ruin his/her experience as a player. But this could be used in short-term experiments, in essence, 5-minute of gameplay instead of 30-minutes. Nonetheless, as the experiment shows in (cite Combining Think-aloud and Physiological Data to Understand Video Game Experiences), which included both think-aloud and physiological data methods, some of the important moments were indicated with EMG, but participants did not say anything about that, which could be left unnoticed.
Player emotions while playing a game are very important and developers usually think thoroughly throughout the development process.
They want some moments to be thrilling or sad or funny to make them memorable for any player. Game designers and user researchers are often looking for methods to better undertand player emotions (cite https://faculty.uoit.ca/nacke/publications/Nacke-Ch26-GameAnalytics.pdf) to make their game more immersive. Researchers do such evaluation because emotions are hard to fake (cite http://hcigames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Games-User-Research-and-Physiological-Game-Evaluation.pdf), especially when it involves gaming as concentration focused on a particular task and so every player reaction is going to be spontaneous.

## Task Analysis
Task analysis is used for breaking a task into small subtasks (cite https://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/sites/autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/files/TaskAnalyis_Steps_0.pdf) and analyzing how one is accomplishing it. JoAnn Hackos and Jenice Redish in their book *User and Task Analysis for Interface Design* (CITE) note a few points to better understand this method:

* What users' goals are;
* What users do to achieve their goal;
* What previous experience users had before accomplishing a task;
* How users are influenced by physical environment;
* How users previous experience influence tasks' understanding and its workflow.

There are a few of task analysis types, two of which are the most common ones - cognitive and hierarchical. There are many techniques for performing cognitive task analysis (CTA), but it generally involves a 5-step iterative process (cite Handbook of research on educational communications and technology: a project of the association for educational communications and technology AND http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/scooper/index_files/pub/horn2017adapting.pdf):

* "Collect preliminary knowledge to identify learning goals, tasks and subjects";
* "Identify knowledge types";
* "Apply focused knowledge elicitation methods";
* "Analyze and verify data";
* "Format results for intended application".

For more detail about CTA, check (cite http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/scooper/index_files/pub/horn2017adapting.pdf). Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) has been developing for over thirty years now and this method has been applied to many years, including evaluation and interface design. It has three leading principles and "is based upon a theory of performance" (cite Hierarchical Task Analysis: Developments, Applications and Extensions). These three principles guiding the analysis have been stated in (cite Annett, J., Duncan, K.D., Stammers, R.B. and Gray, M.J. 1971. Task Analysis, London: HMSO. Training Information Paper No. 6) are:

"1. At the highest level we choose to consider a task as consisting of an operation and the operation is defined in terms of its goal. The goal implies the objective of the system in some real terms of production units, quality or other criteria.
2. The operation can be broken down into sub-operations each defined by a sub-goal again measured in real terms by its contribution to overall system output or goal, and therefore measurable in terms of performance standards and criteria.
3. The important relationship between operations and sub-operations is really one of inclusion; it is a hierarchical relationship. Although tasks are often proceduralised, that is the sub-goal have to be attained in a sequence, this is by no means always the case." (Annett et al, 1971, page 4)

For more detail about HTA, check (cite Hierarchical Task Analysis: Developments, Applications and Extensions).

Also, it's important to note, that the best time to perform task analysis is early in the development process, especially for design work (cite https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/task-analysis.html). Though in most cases task analysis can be beneficial in terms of, for example, discovering what tasks one's website/app should support or making sure the site is efficient, effective and satisfying to users designers should also be aware of over-analyzing (cite http://www.usabilitybok.org/task-analysis). Complex problems might be time-consuming, in addition to getting caught in analysis paralysis, where "more and more detail is investigated" (cite http://www.usabilitybok.org/task-analysis). (420)
